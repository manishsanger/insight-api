# Security Policy

## üîí Data Privacy and Security Guidelines

### Sensitive Data Handling

This project processes **highly sensitive personal information** including:

- **Identity Documents**: Passports, driver's licenses, national ID cards
- **Personal Photos**: Extracted from identity documents
- **Biometric Data**: Facial recognition patterns from documents
- **Personal Information**: Names, addresses, dates of birth, government ID numbers
- **Vehicle Information**: License plates, registration details
- **Audio Recordings**: Voice data containing personal information

### üö® Critical Security Requirements

#### For Developers

1. **NEVER commit real personal documents or data to the repository**
2. **Use only synthetic/anonymized test data for development**
3. **Immediately remove any accidentally committed sensitive files**
4. **Review all commits to ensure no personal data is included**

#### Test Data Guidelines

‚úÖ **SAFE for testing:**
- Synthetic/fake documents created for testing purposes
- Anonymized datasets with no real personal information
- Stock photos of vehicles without visible license plates
- Generated audio with fictional information

‚ùå **NEVER use for testing:**
- Real passports, driver's licenses, or ID cards
- Actual personal photos or documents
- Real license plate numbers or vehicle registrations
- Audio recordings containing real personal information

#### File Exclusions

The following file patterns are automatically excluded from git commits:
```
*.jpeg
*.jpg
*.png
*.gif
*.bmp
*.tiff
passport*
license*
id_card*
test_*
sample_*
data/
uploads/
persistent_storage/
```

### üõ°Ô∏è Production Security Measures

#### Data Protection
- **Encryption in Transit**: Use HTTPS/TLS for all communications
- **Encryption at Rest**: Encrypt database and file storage
- **Access Controls**: Implement strict role-based access
- **Audit Logging**: Log all access to sensitive data (without logging the data itself)

#### Data Retention
- **Automatic Deletion**: Implement automatic deletion of processed data
- **Retention Policies**: Configure appropriate data retention periods
- **Right to Erasure**: Provide mechanisms for data subject requests

#### Network Security
- **Firewall Configuration**: Restrict access to necessary ports only
- **VPN Access**: Use VPN for administrative access
- **Network Segmentation**: Isolate services in secure network segments

#### Authentication & Authorization
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Require MFA for administrative access
- **Strong Passwords**: Enforce strong password policies
- **Session Management**: Implement secure session handling
- **API Keys**: Use secure API key management

### üîç Vulnerability Reporting

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to:

**Email**: [security@yourcompany.com]
**Severity**: High/Critical issues should be reported immediately

Please include:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested remediation (if known)

### üìã Security Checklist for Deployment

#### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] All default passwords changed
- [ ] Environment variables configured securely
- [ ] SSL/TLS certificates installed
- [ ] Security headers configured
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented
- [ ] Input validation tested
- [ ] Authentication mechanisms verified

#### Post-Deployment

- Secure coding practices and code reviews
- Input sanitization and validation
- Error handling without information disclosure

#### Infrastructure Security
- Container security scanning
- Network security configuration
- Database security hardening
- Log management and monitoring
- Backup security and encryption

### üìû Emergency Response

In case of a security incident:

1. **Immediate Response**: Isolate affected systems
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate scope and impact
3. **Notification**: Inform relevant stakeholders
4. **Remediation**: Implement fixes and patches
5. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations
6. **Review**: Conduct post-incident analysis

### üîÑ Regular Security Reviews

- **Monthly**: Security patch updates
- **Quarterly**: Access rights review
- **Annually**: Full security audit
- **Continuous**: Monitoring and threat detection

### üìö Security Resources

- [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)
- [NIST Cybersecurity Framework](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework)
- [ISO 27001 Security Standards](https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-security.html)
- [GDPR Compliance Guidelines](https://gdpr.eu/)

### üìÑ Compliance Considerations

This system may need to comply with:
- **GDPR** (General Data Protection Regulation)
- **CCPA** (California Consumer Privacy Act)
- **HIPAA** (if processing health information)
- **Local data protection laws**

Ensure appropriate legal review and compliance measures are implemented based on your jurisdiction and use case.
